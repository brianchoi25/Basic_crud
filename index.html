            <h2> Focusing on the Future</h2>
            <p class="text">     During my time post grad I worked as an Electrical
                Engineer in the Architectural sector working to work on
                solving our worlds energy and water problems. With 4 years
                experience as a consultant I designed and worked on state of 
                the art projects.

                    I am passionate not only about providing excellence to those 
                around me but pushing to create a better world for those around me.
                To make a better world I carry the motto of having a triple bottom line;
                People, Profit, and Planet.
